# MPO2JPG
Tool to quickly convert from MPO to JPG

Usage

1) For now the app is really lazy.  Stick the built jar into a folder with a bunch of MPO's files and double click it.
2) Wait while it parses through each file, it may take a while

You can also run it from the command line, if you want to see it print a bunch a few messages.  java -jar SideBySideTools.jar
